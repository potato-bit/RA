    "Primarily, we are interested in how Policy H6 affects social housing in Coventry specifically, since there are no explicit requirements on social housing within the plan. The Local Plan sets out that new developments with >25 dwellings or >1ha in area must provide 25% of its dwellings as affordable housing. Further, the Local Plan assesses affordable housing need at the first 4 digits of the postcode level to determine areas of high existing stock of social housing (>1,500 properties) and areas of low existing stock of social housing (<500 properties). Anything in between is determined as medium concentration. Within the geographic areas, the provision of affordable housing is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In areas of high concentration: 10% Social/Affordable Rental Provision; 15% Intermediate Provision\n",
    "* In areas of medium concentration: 12.5% Social/Affordable Rental Provision; 12.5% Intermediate Provision\n",
    "* In areas of low concentration: 15% Social/Affordable Rental Provision; 10% Intermediate Provision\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the intention of this policy is to bring up the level of affordable housing in areas of low concentration but is this setting up misaligned incentives? Areas of high concentration of social housing require fewer social houses making it more attractive to developers (because it gets higher rents) reducing the concentration of social housing and areas of low concentration donâ€™t get as much development (because of the higher social/affordable housing requirement).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Local Plan also recommends that the housing mix of affordable housing should follow the latest SHMA/SHLAA which suggests that houses with 3 or more bedrooms should make up 50% of the housing mix. However, as the 2021 Homefinder data suggests, houses with 3 or more bedrooms only make 14% of socially rented homes. We assume that since Policy H6 does not set out explicit requirements on the size of homes provided within the plan, developers might be building larger homes for the more profitable Intermediate Homes or Affordable Rent sector rather than the social rent sectors which is mostly made up of bedsits, 1BR, and 2BR homes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the Council understands that it may not always be possible for developers to provide the full 25% at every site and thus allows developers to make viability arguments and reach alternative solutions such as off-site delivery or commuted sum payments through the S106 developer's contribution agreement. We expect that this avenue has a significant effect on the delivery of socially rented homes in Coventry and may be contributing to the undersupply problem of homes for Coventry's social housing market.\n",

We also look at how social housing and affordable housing diverges in their delivery and the falling delivery of social housing.
